  This function is necessary in order to allow for the defservice macro to
  support arbitrary code in the body. A fnk will attempt to determine what
  its output-schema is, but will only work if a map is immediately returned
  from the body. When a map is not immediately returned (i.e. a `let` block

  "Define a service that may depend on other services, and provides functions

    * a body of code that returns a map of functions the service provides.
      The keys of the map must match the values of the :provides vector.
