;;;; Application Shutdown Support
;;;;
;;;; The next section of this namespace
;;;; provides top-level functions to be called by TrapperKeeper internally
;;;; and a shutdown service for application services to utilize.
;;;;
;;;; Performing the actual shutdown is relatively easy, but dealing with
;;;; exceptions during shutdown and providing various ways for services
;;;; to trigger shutdown make up most of the code in this namespace.
;;;;
;;;; During development of this namespace we wanted to ensure that the
;;;; shutdown sequence occurred on the main thread and not on some
;;;; service's worker thread. Because of this, a Clojure `promise` is
;;;; used to pass contextual shutdown information back to the main thread,
;;;; at which point it is responsible for calling back into this namespace
;;;; to perform the appropriate shutdown steps.
;;;;
;;;; As a consequence of the implementation, the main blocking behavior of
;;;; TrapperKeeper is defined here by `wait-for-app-shutdown`. This function
;;;; simply attempts to dereference the above mentioned promise, which
;;;; until it is realized (e.g. by a call to `deliver`) will block, and the
;;;; delivered value returned. This value will contain contextual information
;;;; regarding the cause of the shutdown, and is intended to be passed back
;;;; in to the top-level functions that perform various shutdown steps.
