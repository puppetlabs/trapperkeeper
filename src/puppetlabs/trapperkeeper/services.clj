  Second argument is the dependency list; this should be a vector of vectors.
  Each inner vector should begin with a keyword representation of the name of the
  service protocol that the service depends upon.  All remaining items in the inner
  vectors should be symbols representing functions that should be imported from
  the service.

  The remaining arguments should be function definitions for this service, specified
  in the format that is used by a normal clojure `reify`.  The legal list of functions
  that may be specified includes whatever functions are defined by this service's
  protocol (if it has one), plus the list of functions in the `Lifecycle` protocol."
